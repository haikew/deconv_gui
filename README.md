# deconv_gui

This repository currently does not contain any source code. It serves as a placeholder for a graphical user interface (GUI) project related to image deconvolution.

## Environment setup

The project is expected to use **Python 3.11**. To prepare a virtual environment, run the following commands:

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -U pip
```

When the actual source code is added, any required Python packages should be installed with `pip` and documented in a `requirements.txt` file.

## Running tests

There are currently no automated tests in this repository. After adding code, tests should be placed in a `tests/` directory and executed with:

```bash
pytest
```

## Contributing

Please open an issue or pull request if you intend to contribute code or documentation.
